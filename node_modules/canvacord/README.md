## Installation

```sh
$ npm install canvacord
```

Canvacord stays away from node-gyp based dependencies, so you don't have to worry about weird errors while installing the library. Although canvacord utilizes [@napi-rs/canvas](https://npm.im/@napi-rs/canvas) under the hood, it is recommended to use the builder api for image generation. Only utilize the canvas api if you need to perform image manipulation.
